# White Hamburger Buns
Dough made in the bread maker. Original source [here](https://pudgefactor.com/homemade-hamburger-buns-bread-machine/).

## Ingredients
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/4 cup water (total volume af egg, milk, and water should be 8 oz after the water is added, but I just did the 1/4 cup)
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter (when I made this, my butter was salted, so I put a little less salt)
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/8 tsp bread machine yeast

Optional
* Egg whites for brushing

## Instructions
1. Add all ingredients to the bread maker pan in the order above
2. Set machine to the dough setting, and start
3. When machine has finished, transfer dough to floured surface and into 6 (~97g)or 8 (~71g) equal pieces
4. Form each piece into a ball and place on parchment-lined baking sheet
5. Flatten each piece until it is about 1/2 inches thick.
6. Cover, allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, ~30-35 mins (I actually completely missed this step, and they turned out very light and fluffy anyway)
7. (Optional: brush buns with egg whites before cooking and after rising. I didn't do this, but the original recipe mentions it)
8. Preheat oven to 400F, then bake buns for 10-12 mins, or until golden brown
9. Remove from oven and transfer to wire rack to cool
