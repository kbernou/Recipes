# Pizza Dough
Thanks Cole.

## Ingredients
* Water 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp
* Salt 3/4 tsp
* Olive Oil 2 tbsp
* All-Purpose Flour 2.5 cups
* Sugar 2 tsp
* Active Dry Yeast 2 tsp

## Instructions
Yeet everything into the bread maker.  
Select setting 8 (Dough) on bread maker and start. Remove when the display reads 0 and it's yelling at you.  
Pat dough into greased 12-inch pizza pan / 12 x 15 inch jelly roll pan.  
Let stand 10 mins.  
Preheat oven to 400F.  
Spread sauce over dough.  
Sprinkle toppings over sauce.  
Bake 15-20 mins, or until crust is golden brown.  

## Additional Considerations
Baking for closer to 25 mins, at least with half the dough in my little toaster oven, yielded better pizza.  
Cooking in a _heavily_ oiled circular glass baking dish with half the dough, combined with the longer duration, yielded better pizza.
