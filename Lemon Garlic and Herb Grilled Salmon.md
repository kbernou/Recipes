# Lemon, Garlic, and Herb Grilled Salmon
Tasty. Found originally on [Cooking Classy](https://www.cookingclassy.com/lemon-garlic-herb-grilled-salmon/).

## Ingredients
* 4 (6 - 7 oz) skinless salmon fillets
  * I actually used a whole side of salmon, and it worked perfectly fine. I just cooked it a tad longer because I'm paranoid.
* 1/4 cup lemon juice (fresh is preferred)
* 1/4 cup olive oil, plus extra for brushing the grill
* 2 Tbsp finely minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
  *  ~half that dried is good too
*  4 Tsp finely minced fresh rosemary
  *  ~half that dried is good too
*  2 cloves minced garlic (2 Tsp)
*  2 Tsp fresh lemon zest
*  1 Tsp dijon mustard
*  1 Tsp honey
*  1 Tsp Salt (or to taste)
*  1/2 Tsp Pepper (or to taste)

## Instructions
1. Place salmon in an 11x7 inch dish
2. In a small mixing bowl, whist together the above ingredients, whisk together all of the ingredients, except the salmon, until well combined.
3. Pour mixture over salmon (lift so that the underside gets coverage as well)
4. Marinate in the fridge for 30 mins, flipping halfway through
5. In the last 10 mins of marinating, preheat the grill to medium-high
6. Brush grill grates with oil, spoon some of the marinade over the salmon (or use hands to spread), place salmon on grill
7. Grill ~3 - 5 mins per side to cook through
    * When doing this with a side of salmon, I cooked it for much longer to ensure the internal temperature got to 145F. I'm not sure if this is strictly nescesary but I'm not about to be making people sick 

## Notes
* I used a side of salmon instead, but just cooked it longer, until it just about reached 145F. Everything else worked as-is just fine.
* Using dried herbs instead of fresh, but in a smaller quantity, works just fine
* Ignoring the zest is okay, but it's probably better with it.
