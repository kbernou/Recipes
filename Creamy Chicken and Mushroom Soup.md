## Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 8 ounces boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 1 onion, diced
* 3 carrots, peeled and diced
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 cup half and half, or more, as needed*
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
* 1 sprig rosemary

## Instructions
1. Heat olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chicken to the stockpot and cook until golden, about 2-3 minutes; set aside.
2. Melt butter in the stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic, mushrooms, onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in chicken stock, bay leaf and chicken thighs, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 4-5 minutes.
4. Stir in half and half until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. If the soup is too thick, add more half and half as needed until desired consistency is reached.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and rosemary, if desired.

## Additional Considerations
* May be improved with slightly less stock
