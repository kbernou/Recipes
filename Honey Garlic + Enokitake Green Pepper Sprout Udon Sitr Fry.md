# Honey Garlic Enokitake Green Pepper Sproud Udon Stiry Fry Mouthful
I think the body I cobbled together, the sauce came from... somewhere online.

## Ingredients
Body:
* 287g green pepper
* 221g onion
* 250g bean sprouts
* 200g Enokitake mushrooms
* 400g firm tofu

Sauce:  
Makes 1-1/4 cups  
Keeps in the fridge for about 1 week
* 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (or Tamari if gluten free)
* 1/2 cup chicken stock (or vegetable broth if vegan)
* 1 tablespoon corn starch (or arrow root)
* 1 tablespoon honey (or agave nectar if vegan)
* 1 teaspoon sesame seed oil
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 2 inch piece of ginger, peeled and grated or finely minced (or 1 tablespoon ginger paste in a squeeze tube, and other readers have had success with 1 tablespoon ground powdered ginger)
* 2 garlic cloves, grated or finely minced

## Instructions
Sauce: 
1. Whisk all ingredients together. Adjust the amount of sauce you add according to how much stir fry youâ€™re making. 
2. When adding to your stir fry, allow to cook for 3 full minutes to allow the corn starch to thicken the sauce.
    
All together:
Use typical stir fry techniques
