# Slow Cooker Cookie
Reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/fy12c7/homemade_slow_cooker_giant_chocolate_chip_cookie/

## Ingredients
* 100g of butter
* 100g of caster/powdered sugar
* 75g of brown sugar
* 200g of flour
* 250g of chocolate chips
* 1 egg
* bit of salt
* 1tbsp of vanilla extract
* 1tbsp baking powder

## Instructions
Batter:
1. Mix softened butter with both sugars, then add egg, baking powder, and vanilla extract; 
2. Mix well, then add the flour. Mix it all with electrical mixer, until fairly smooth. 
3. Fold in chocolate chips

Cooking:
1. Line slow cooker with parchment paper. 
2. Pour batter into slow cooker. 
3. Cook on low for 3.5 hours, then on high for 30 mins (With a bigger, more normal slow cooker: Cook on high for ~2.5 hours)
4. Should be about done, poke it with a toothpick. If it makes you happy, eat it!

Does end up with a gooey centre for me, but that's what I like. In larger, more normal slow cookers then it might be more cooked through.
