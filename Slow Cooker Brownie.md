# Instructions
1. Using two long 5” to 6” strips parchment paper, line the bowl of a 4-quart slow cooker in an “x” formation and spray generously with cooking spray.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together butter, sugars, cocoa powder, flour, eggs, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Fold in chocolate chips and pour batter into prepared slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 5 hours, or until set around the edges and slightly gooey in the center.
