# White Cake
Original recipe [here](https://sugarspunrun.com/the-best-white-cake-recipe/#recipe). Pairs well with [Hershey's Frosting](Hershey's%20Chocolate%20Frosting.md).

Note that I did the [reverse creaming](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/03/09/what-is-reverse-creaming-and-why-does-it-make-great-cake) method instead of what's written below. This method is quicker, easier, and results in a more tender, moister cake. The cakes made this way tend to be flatter, and slightly denser.

## Ingredients
* 85g softened unsalted butter
* 160ml canola/vegetable oil
* 400g sugar
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 345g all-purpose flour
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 235ml milk (room temp preferred)
* 6 large egg whites (room temp)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper, greasing and flouring the sides. Shake out extra flour.
3. Beat butter until creamy
4. Add sugar and oil, beat until all ingredients are well-combined and creamy
5. Scrape own the sides, stir in vanilla extract
6. In a separate bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together.
7. With mixer on medium speed, alternat between adding the dry ingredients and the milk to the butter mixture. Start and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until each one is almost combined, then add the next. Pause regularly to scrape the sides.
8. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form
9. Gently fold whites into batter with a spatula. Keep scraping those sides so nothing is left out.
10. Divide batter evently into the two pans
11. Bake for 35-40 mins, or until a toothpick comes out clean and cake is golden brown. For best results, rotate cake pans halfeay thorugh baking.
12. Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes. 
13. Run a knife around the inside rim of each pan and invert each onto a cooling rack
14. Allow to cool completely on the racks before frosting
