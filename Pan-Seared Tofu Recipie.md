# Pan-seared Tofu
"This recipe comes courtesy of my mom, who's never used Reddit before but does love cheap and healthy cooking. Coming from a non-vegetarian Chinese guy, this stuff is f-ing delicious. It's a uper easy vegetarian protein, and all you need is a non-stick pan, a block of tofu, oil, salt, and soy sauce."

## Ingredients
* 1 package of firm tofu 
* 1-2 tablespoons oil 
* Salt 
* 1 tbsp soy sauce 
* 1 tbsp water 
* 1/2 tbsp sugar (optional) 
* 2-3 green onions, cut into inch-long segments and halved (optional) 
* 1 tbsp Lao Gan Ma (Chili Oil with Black Beans) (optional but wow it tastes good)

## Instructions
1. Cut tofu in half vertically/lengthwise, then again parallel to the cutting board, then horizontally across into slices
1. Heat non-stick saute pan over medium-high heat and add oil
1. Place tofu into pan when oil is hot (not smoking)
1. Don't stir the tofu and leave a little space between each square
1. Add salt to the top of the tofu
1. When the bottom edges turn golden brown or when the tofu releases from the pan, flip the tofu one-by-one in order of placement (if too soft to flip, let it cook longer)
1. Once the other side of the tofu is brown, add green onions to pan, lower heat, and cover; allow tofu to take in the flavor for 2-3 minutes
1. Add soy sauce, water, Lao Gan Ma, and some sugar, and stir tofu to coat

Tl;dr: put firm tofu into a pan, sear each side to golden brown perfection, add a splash of soy sauce if you want, and 
serve.
