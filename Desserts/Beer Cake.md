# Beer Cake
Original [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/evygp1/beer_cake/ffyrev4/).

## Ingredients
### Cake
* 1 cup shortening
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 cups beer
  * I used a lighter lager which was good. Some other cake recipes call for porters or stouts so those might work well too. One commenter notes they made the cake with a vanilla porter and it was ["DELICIOUS!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/evygp1/beer_cake/fg8ulqe/).
* 3 cups flour
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt

### Topping
* 2/3 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup melted butter
* Some milk to thin

## Instructions
### Cake
1. Preheat oven to 375F
2. Grease and flour a bundt cake pan
   * I don't have this pan, so I used a big glass baking dish. It wasn't pretty, and cracked a lot, but it cooked fine otherwise.
3.  Combine all ingredients. Pour into the pan
   * I did the "reverse creaming" method of beating the fat (shortening) into all the dry ingredients. Haven't made this without doing that but it worked great for another cake I made.
4. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a knife (or toothpick) comes out clean
   * Because I didn't have the correct pan, I started checking it after 25 minutes, then every ~5 mins after that. 
5. Let cool, remove from pan, transfer to cookie sheet

### Topping
1. Melt butter and sugar together
2. Mix well, adding a little milk to thin it out. Only a little is needed
3. Drizzle over cooled cake
4. Broil in the oven for a couple minutes. Watch for the topping to bubble and brown. Don't turn your back on it!
