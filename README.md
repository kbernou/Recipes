# Recipie Book
This is a collection of recipes that I've collected over the years. Most I have 
made myself, some looked interesting but I haven't gotten around to.

Almost none of these are my own creations. They've been gathered from friends, 
family, and across the internet. I apologize for not linking to original sources 
(when available), my priority with these was to keep the recipes I've made that 
were good for myself should the original sources be lost. I don't suppose many 
family cook books have their original sources listed either!

Given the bachelor life I lead, many of these recipes lean on the inexpensive 
side.

Could stand to organize these into folders.
