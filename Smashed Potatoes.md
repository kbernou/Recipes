  # Smashed Potatoes
  ## Ingredients
  * Potatoes (preferably those little ones, unless you want to cut big ones and end up with mostly mashed potatoes, or a giant smashed potato)
  * 1 tsp onion powder
  * 1 tsp paprika
  * 1 tsp oregano
  * 1 tsp red pepper flakes
  * Salt to taste
  
  ## Instructions
  1. Boil potatoes until soft enough to mash. If they're bigger, cut in half.
  2. Mix oil and seasonings together while potatoes are boiling
  3. Line baking sheet with foil, and apply some oil to prevent sticking
  4. Place boiled potatoes on foil-lined sheet
  5. Smash the potatoes (a small glass or ramekin works well). They should still have a little bit of thickness to them; don't smash down completely.
  6. Spread half of the oil+seasoning mixture over the potatoes
  7. Bake at 425F for 30 mins
  8. Flip, and add the rest of the seasoning to the other side.
  9. Bake for another 30 mins
  10. If they're not crispy, broil for several mins
