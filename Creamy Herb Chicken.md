## Ingredients
### For The Chicken

* 4 chicken breasts (pounded 1/2-inch thin)
* 2 teaspoons each of onion powder and garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley
* 1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary*
* salt and pepper , to season

### For The Sauce

* 4 cloves garlic , minced (or 1 tablespoon minced garlic)
* 1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley
* 1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary
* 1 cup milk (or half and half)*
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water , until smooth

## Instructions
1. Coat chicken breasts with the onion and garlic powders and herbs. Season generously with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken breasts until opaque and no longer pink inside (about 5 minutes each side, depending on thickness). Transfer to a plate; set aside.
3. To the same pan or skillet, heat another 2 teaspoons of olive oil and saut√© garlic, with parsley, thyme and rosemary, for about 1 minute, or until fragrant.
4. Stir in milk (or cream); season with salt and pepper, to taste.
5. Bring to a boil; add the cornstarch mixture to the centre of the pan, quickly stirring, until sauce has thickened slightly. Reduce heat and simmer gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken more.
6. Return chicken to the skillet. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.

## Notes
* If you don't like Thyme or Rosemary, substitute these with Basil and Oregano, or use Tarragon.
* For a dairy free option, I find Cashew milk the best in flavour. You can also use almond milk or rice milk. Yes, heavy cream can be substituted!
