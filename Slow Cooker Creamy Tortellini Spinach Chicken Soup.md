# Slow Cooker Creamy Tortellini, Spinach and Chicken Soup
Original source [here](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/slow-cooker-tortellini-spinach-soup/).
## Ingredients
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* 1/3 cup all purpose flour
* 1 tbsp dried basil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 14.5 oz diced tomatoes
* ~1.25 lbs bonless, skinless chicken thighs (honestly at that point you can probably just use breasts, whatever's cheap, but  I haven't tried)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 4 cups cheese tortellini
* 3 cups packed spinach (more more if you want)
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
* 1 cup heavy cream, or half and half

## Instructions
1. In a microwave-safe bowl add the onions, flour, basil, garlic, tomato paste and drizzle with olive oil. Microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 90 seconds or so. (The mixture will be pasty and look weird but donâ€™t worry it will all be okay in the end). Add the mixture to the slow cooker.
2. Add broth, tomatoes, chicken, salt and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir.
3. Cover and cook on LOW for 4-6 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours (or until chicken is very tender).
4. Remove the lid use a fork to remove the chicken out of the slow cooker.  And add in tortellini and spinach, Parmesan cheese and warmed cream (cream should be warmed because it may cause curdling if added in cold).
5.  On a cutting board, shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker. Put the lid back on and cook on HIGH for about 10 more minutes, or until the tortellini are cooked through. Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!

## Notes
* Original recipe used 6 quart oval slow cooker. I don't know how big mine is but it's a smaller round one. Couldn't fit all the spinach in but added some after serving a couple bowls while it was still hot, worked just fine.
* Apparently there is an instant pot cersion [here](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/instant-pot-creamy-tortellini-spinach-and-chicken-soup/) but I haven't tried it.
