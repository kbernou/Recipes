## Ingredients
### Main
* Nice large onion or two, up to you based on taste
* ~1lb mixed shrooms
* 4+ tbsp butter
* Splash of quality balsamic vinegar
* ~0.5 cups dry white wine, such has Chardonnay
* like, 8 tbsp/cloves of garlic
* 1.5 cups arborio rice
* Lots of ground black pepper
* 5-7 cups warm flavoured liquid, such as chicken or vegetable stock
### Garnishes/flavour enhancers
* Couple tsp of lemon juice
* Parmesan
* Balsamic glaze

## Instructions
1. Prep your onions and shrooms.
   * Onions should probably be diced. Mushrooms we're looking for diced, sliced, ripped... Whatever you like and works for their size
2. Heat 2 tbsp butter in a larg pot.
3. Start sauteeing the onions. You're looking for lightly browned. Could also go slower and head towards partial caramelization.
4. Toss them shrooms in with a bit of salt. Cook until they've released all their water, and have become crisp and taken a deep golden colour. Should take ~20 mins.
5. Add the garlic, thyme, and some pepper (and salt if you need it). Cook for a minute or so until fragrant.
6. Deglaze the pot with the white wine.
7. Add the rice to the pot and cook until it toasts slightly, ~2 mins.
8. Stirring the mixture constantly, add 1 cup of liquid at a time. Don't add more until the entirety of the previous cup has been absorbed. Overall this will take 5-7 cups and ~40 mins.
9. Turn heat off when rice is cooked al dente and has taken on a creamy texture.
10. Toss in the last 2 tbsp of butter, and mix.
    * Can also mix in the garnishes now, or just place on top after. I like to mix them in.
12. Let rest 5 mins.
13. Serve.
