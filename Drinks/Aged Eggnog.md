# Eggnog
_Slob on my nog_

A copy of Alton Brown's recipe originally found [here](https://altonbrown.com/recipes/aged-eggnog/)

## Ingredients
* 12 Eggers
* 454g/1lb Sugar
* 1 tsp Nutmeg
* 473ml/1 pint Half-and-half
* 473ml/1 pint Whole milk
* 473ml/1 pint Heavy cream
* 237ml/1 cup Jamaican rum
* 237ml/1 cup Cognac
* 237ml/1 cup Bourbon
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt

## Instructions
1. Separate the yolks of the eggs. Keep them, and store the whites for another use.
2. Beat the yolks with the sugar and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl until the mixture lightens in color and falls off the whisk in a solid ribbon.
3. Combine dairy, booze, and salt in a second bowl or pitcher and then slowly beat into the egg mixture.
4. Move to a large glass jar (or a couple of smaller ones) and store in the fridge for a minimum of 2 weeks. 2-3 months is ideal, but no reason one couldn't store it for a year. It's also edible immediately. 
5. (Optional) Serve in mugs or cups topped with a little extra nutmeg grated on top.

## Notes
* It ends up being a little heavy on the liquour, but delicious nonetheless.
* I did age it for 2 months my first try, as a Redditor suggested. I don't think 3 (or even a year, as suggested above) would be bad though.
* When distributing into jars for aging, I had a slight issue with the last jar having most of the solid seasoning, as it sank to the bottom. Maybe try to stir it better if you don't have one big jar to store it in.
